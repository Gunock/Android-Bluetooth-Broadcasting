# Android-Bluetooth-Broadcasting

## Overview

Android for broadcasting messages via Bluetooth.
* Written using Kotlin and MVVM pattern
* Minimum Android 6.0 (API 23)

## How to use
Here are some instructions if you would like to use my Bluetooth server and client classes.

### BluetoothServer
Bluetooth server exposes RFCOMM service, manages client connections and allows broadcasting messages to all connected clients.

1. Constructor and operations:
``` kotlin
val server = BluetoothServer(
    bluetoothAdapter,
    SERVICE_NAME,
    SERVICE_UUID
)

// Recommended use on IO thread
server.startloop()
server.stop()

server.broadcastMessage("Something")
```
2. Bluetooth server has several listeners available:
``` kotlin
bluetoothServer.setOnConnectListener { clientSocket: BluetoothSocket ->
    // Do something
}

bluetoothServer.setOnDisconnectListener { clientSocket: BluetoothSocket ->
    // Do something
}

bluetoothServer.setOnStateChangeListener { isStopped: Boolean ->
    // Do something
}
```

### BluetoothClient
Bluetooth client allows connection to server and handles incoming messages.

1. Constructor and operations:
``` kotlin
val client =
  BluetoothClient(
      device,       // Server device
      SERVICE_UUID  // Server service ID
  ) { message: ByteArray ->
      // Do something
  }
  
// Recommended use on IO thread
client.startloop()
client.disconnect()

```
2. Bluetooth client has several listeners available:
``` kotlin
client.setOnConnectionSuccessListener { serverSocket: BluetoothSocket ->
  // Do something
}

client.setOnConnectionFailureListener { serverSocket: BluetoothSocket ->
  // Do something
}

client.setOnDisconnectionListener { serverSocket: BluetoothSocket ->
  // Do something
}

// This replaces the listener given in constructor
client.setOnDataListener { message: ByteArray ->
  // Do something
}
```


### BluetoothServiceDiscoveryManager
A helper class for acquiring bluetooth devices which host desired service.

1. Constructor:
``` kotlin
BluetoothServiceDiscoveryManager(
    context,
    listOf(serviceUuid)
)
```
2. You must register receiver (without doing it manager can't handle *fetchUuidsWithSdp* results):
``` kotlin
activity.registerReceiver(
    serviceDiscoveryManager.receiver,
    IntentFilter(BluetoothDevice.ACTION_UUID)
)
```
3. Discover services on given devices:
``` kotlin
serviceDiscoveryManager.discoverServicesInDevices(pairedDevices)
```
4. You can observe devices with desired services:
``` kotlin
serviceDiscoveryManager.devices.observe(this) { collection: Set<BluetoothDevice> ->
    // Do something
}
```

## Libraries Used
* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
* [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Easy, type safe, null safe access to layout elements.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)- Build data objects that notify views when the underlying data changes.
* [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview?gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=CjwKCAjwrPCGBhALEiwAUl9X03wCNk7bhvoxs_okW86jFVgc92QelSerqKyYmfEM54CbHOsKc3tYyxoCgRcQAvD_BwE) for custom list views.
